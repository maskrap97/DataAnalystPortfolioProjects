**skills used** (*joins, case statements, aliases, group by, order by, agreggate functions and CTEs*)

MySQL project utilizing DBeaver database tool for finding useful metrics at the halfway point of the 2021 college football season such as:

* Rank based solely on record
* Combined total offensive and total defensive rank
* Rank based on touchdown differential (Touchdowns scored-Touchdown given up)
* Rank based on Yards per Play differential (Yards per play offense-Yards per play defense)
* Conference based rankings for each of the previous three metrics

**skills used** (*distinct, where in, aliases, group by, order by, agreggate functions and CTEs*)

MySQL queries utilizing DBeaver database tool for Data Visualization including:

* Total crime in each state
* Property versus violent crime rates in each state
* Average crime rates in each state
